Loaded voltage gain (at 1 kHz and with RL = 1 kΩ): No smaller than 90% of the no-load voltage gain
Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 kHz and RL = 1 kΩ): No smaller than 4 V peak to peak
Input resistance (at 1 kHz): No smaller than 20 kΩ
Amplifier type: Inverting or non-inverting
Frequency response: 20 Hz to 50 kHz (−3dB response)
Type of transistors: BJT
